"""Provides calculation for Average True Range (ATR).

ATR is a technical analysis volatility indicator originally developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr.
This module contains the `calculate_atr` function to compute ATR values from
high, low, and close price series.

    """Calculates the Average True Range (ATR).

    The True Range (TR) is defined as the greatest of the following:
    - Current High less the current Low
    - Absolute value of the current High less the previous Close
    - Absolute value of the current Low less the previous Close

    ATR is then calculated as a Wilder's Smoothing Moving Average of TR.
    The first ATR value is a simple average of the TR for the initial `period`.
    Subsequent values are calculated as:
    `ATR = (PreviousATR * (period - 1) + CurrentTR) / period`

    Args:
        high_prices (pd.Series): A pandas Series of high prices.
        low_prices (pd.Series): A pandas Series of low prices.
        close_prices (pd.Series): A pandas Series of close prices.
                                  The index of all three series must align.
        period (int, optional): The lookback period for ATR calculation.
                                Defaults to 14.

    Returns:
        pd.Series: A pandas Series containing the ATR values, with the same index
                   as the input price series. Values before the first full period
                   will be `NaN`. Returns an empty Series with the original index
                   if input data length is less than the period.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If inputs are not pandas Series or have mismatched lengths,
                    or if `period` is not a positive integer.
