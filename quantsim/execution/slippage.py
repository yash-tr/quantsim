"""Defines slippage models for simulated order execution.

This module provides an abstract base class `SlippageModel` and concrete
implementations such as `PercentageSlippage` and `ATRSlippage`. These models
are used by the `SimulatedExecutionHandler` to adjust fill prices from the
reference market price, simulating market impact or adverse price movement.

    """Abstract base class for all slippage models.

    Custom slippage models should inherit from this class and implement the
    `calculate_slippage` method. This design allows for easy extension of
    slippage simulation logic.

    To create a custom slippage model:
    1. Inherit from this `SlippageModel` class.
    2. Implement the `calculate_slippage` method.
    3. The `calculate_slippage` method must accept `order_event` (OrderEvent) and
       `market_price` (float: the price before slippage), and `market_event` (Optional[MarketEvent]).
    4. Use `market_event` to access any additional data your model might need. For example,
       if your model requires the current Average True Range (ATR), the `OrderEvent`
       should be augmented to carry this `current_atr` value. The `SimulatedExecutionHandler`
       will then pass `atr_value=order_event.current_atr` when calling your model.
       Your implementation would then retrieve it via `atr_value = market_event.atr_value`.
    5. The method should return the calculated fill price (float) after applying slippage.
